Here the general steps for launching our application instances
(TODO: fill in load balancer steps)

[Steps 1-3 already finished in deploy script]
1) Create security group, ssh key
2) Create mongo db instance with docker
3) Initialize and run mongo scripts in tracker/api/scripts
    * init.mongo.js
    * generate_data.mongo.js


4) Add mongo ip to .env file in tracker-api
    DB_URL=mongodb://ADDRESS_HERE/issuetracker
5) Set CORS policy to true
    ENABLE_CORS=true

6) Create EC2 instance for UI and API applications (can just run on 1 instance)
7) Install node with nvm using nvm_node_install.sh in install_scripts/
    ** Make sure that correct version of node is being used (10.24.0)
    ** Known bug where the terminal needs to be closed and reopened before node can be used

8) Add UI_API_ENDPOINT with EC2 instance IP address
    UI_API_ENDPOINT=http://ADDRESS_HERE:3000/graphql

9) Run api_run.sh bash script
10) Run ui_run.sh bash script

Application should be up and running, check the following ips

API: http://EC2_INSTANCE_IP:3000/graphql
UI: http://EC2_INSTANCe_IP:8000
